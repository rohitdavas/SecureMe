1. (p4)add IFTT link as a variable. It should be a runtime variable.

2. (p3)Notification send image as the message. 

   >  First, select Send a rich notification from the IFTTT app as **that** service while creating the applet on IFTTT. Then, when motion is detected, we upload the frame as an image to a location such as https://imgur.com and get a URL for it. Then, post the image URL to the IFTTT webhook as a parameter and use the URL as the image URL in the rich format notification, which can have an image URL in its body.

3. (p5)Add option as what type of object it is. 

4. (p2)Add comments to the code.

5. (p1)Build the ready to release format for linux.
